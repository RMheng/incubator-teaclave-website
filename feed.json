We also organized several\noffline meetups to build up and grow the Teaclave family. In addition, for\nbetter explaining the project, we introduced the blog in the Teaclave homepage\nand then published an article about the ecosystem.\nIn this article, we spent some time to summarize existing open source projects\npowered by Teaclave. Last but not least, we also attended SGX Workshop and\nApacheCon to introduce our project. Overall we're very glad to see the\ndevelopment of the project and growth of the community.",
