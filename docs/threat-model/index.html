confidentiality even if all parties along the computation path, privileged or
not, are untrusted. This includes:</p> <ul><li>Internet service provider</li> <li>Cloud provider</li> <li>Function provider</li> <li>Other data providers</li></ul> <p>Specifically, most hardware (memory, disk, motherboard, etc.), operating system
(both kernel and software in userland), network channels, and provider employees
are untrusted.</p> <p>Consider the following scenario. A small business needs to employ image
classification techniques in its daily production. However, the business does
not have the capabilities to train a high-quality machine learning model, nor
does it have the hardware resources to host the machine learning
infrastructures. Under such circumstances, the only solution is to subscribe to
some cloud computing service and run the needed image classification tasks
remotely. However, this solution requires the small business to upload its
private data to the cloud, which may deeply concerns the business owner and
hinders the deployment of such techniques.</p> <p>With Teaclave, privacy concerns above are no more. The small business can
subscribe to the cloud service from company A, rent the machine learning model
from company B, and use the deep learning inference engine provided by company
C. None of these parties need to trust another, yet the computation can commence
with everyone's privacy respected.</p> <p>In the settings above, the root of trust converges to the enclave manufactures
(i.e., Intel) and its SGX-enabled CPU chips. Before the computation starts,
Teaclave is booted as a secure SGX enclave on one of these CPUs owned by the
cloud service provider. After that, each party can <em>remotely</em> attest the
authenticity of the hardware and the integrity of Teaclave platform through
attestation service (e.g., Intel Attestation Service). Private data are securely
provisioned to the Teaclave enclave only if the attestation passes. After the
provision, no privileged software is able to access the memory content owned by
the enclave from outside.</p> <p>The remote attestation functionality implemented by Teaclave is augmented from
the method described by a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05863" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">white paper<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>. In a
nutshell, enclaves in Teaclave will establish trusted channel on attested TLS
for communication. The complicated structure of Teaclave requires additional
work for remote attestation, which is explained in details via a separate
<a href="/teaclave/docs/mutual_attestation.html">documentation</a>.</p> <p>Side channels are out of scope for current Teaclave's implementation. While we
acknowledge that existing enclaves may be vulnerable to various kinds of side
channel attacks, we will try our best to mitigate existing attacks by adopting
software hardening.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
