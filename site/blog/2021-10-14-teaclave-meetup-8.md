We are going to have the 8th monthly Teaclave (virtual) meetup. The
meetup in this month is scheduled on Oct 14, 2021 (PT):

- 19:00-20:00 on Thursday, Oct 14, 2021 (PT)

You can find the corresponding date time in your TZ here:

As usual, I'll give an update of Teaclave first. Then, we're glad to invite
Shunfan Zhou to talk about *experiences on using and customizing Teaclave SGX
SDK*. At last, we will have an open discussion session on recent news/projects
around confidential computing.

I also create a Google Calendar for the recurring events. Please
subscribe if you're interested.

At last, same as the previous meetup, please RSVP for the Zoom link (or find it
in the shared calendar). Thanks!
